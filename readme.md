# Pascals Triangle Algo in Python

## This implementation demonstrates how to generate the elements of a Pascal's triangle.

> The element having a row index of r and column index of c can be derivedvas follows:
> * triangle[r][c] = triangle[r-1][c-1]+triangle[r-1][c]

* A Pascal's triangle is a triangular array containing binomial coefficients: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle) *
